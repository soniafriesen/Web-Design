     <h1>The Hits</h1>
     <p><img src="images/queengreatesthits.jpg" width ="900" alt="greatest hit album"/>Seven Seas of Rhye was Queen's first hit song from their second album Queen II. International fame wouldn't come until the release of their third album Sheer Heart Attack with hit song Killer Queen. Night at the Opera was their fourth album released in 1975. Bohemian Rhapsody, a 5 minute and 55 second song mixed different styles and music genres. Many record companies doubted the success of the song due to the fact that they mixed opera with rock. However, this song was a high success. In 1977 Queen released News of the World which had We Are the Champions and We Will Rock you which are used as sports anthems today. Queen released a "greatest hits" compilation album which featured Another Bites the Dust, Fat Bottomed Girls, Don't Stop Me Now, Crazy Little Thing Called Love, and much more fan favourites.</p>
